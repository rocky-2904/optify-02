# Caesar Cipher:
 The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. It is named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it in his private correspondence.
# How it works:
Each letter in the message is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 3:
A becomes D
B becomes E
C becomes F
…and so on.
The key in a Caesar Cipher is the number of positions to shift the alphabet, often between 1 and 25.

Encryption Example:
Plaintext: HELLO
Key (shift): 3
Ciphertext: KHOOR
To decrypt, the shift is reversed. If the encryption shift was +3, decryption involves shifting back by -3.

# Strengths:
Simple and fast to implement.
# Weaknesses:
Easily breakable using frequency analysis or brute force, as there are only 25 possible shifts.
# Vigenère Cipher:
The Vigenère Cipher is a more sophisticated cipher compared to Caesar, using a keyword to vary the shift for each letter in the message. It is a polyalphabetic cipher, meaning it uses multiple Caesar ciphers based on the characters of the keyword.

# How it works:
The key is a word or phrase.
Each letter of the key corresponds to a shift. For example, if the key is KEY:
K shifts by 10 positions (K is the 11th letter, starting at A=0).
E shifts by 4 positions.
Y shifts by 24 positions.
The process repeats for each letter in the plaintext, cycling through the letters of the key.
Encryption Example:
Plaintext: HELLO
Key: KEY
Key shifts: K (10), E (4), Y (24), repeat…
Ciphertext: RIJVS
Decryption:
To decrypt, the reverse shift based on the key is applied to each letter.
# Strengths:
More secure than Caesar Cipher because the shifting pattern varies, making frequency analysis attacks more difficult.
Larger keyspace means brute-force attacks are much harder.
# Weaknesses:
Still vulnerable to cryptanalysis if the keyword is short or if patterns in the key are revealed.
